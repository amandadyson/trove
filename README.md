<b>Trove Web Prototype and Marketing Site</b>
<br>
<br>
Trove came from the idea that there should be one place to hold everything you need, available on any device. Trove is for users and collaborators that want to quickly organize and find notes, images, and links. 
<br>
<br>
Trove is the first project I completed during my design apprenticeship. I kept the goals of an assigned project, named “blocbox,” and took it a step further by creating a new name, logo, and layout. Competitive analysis, user surveys, and user interviews all contributed to trove’s structure and design. I carried out user testing on wireframes and then prototypes to hone in on a responsive interface that met project goals as well as user needs.

<b>PROBLEM</b>
<br>
Most of us are working collaboratively, and yet we’re saving and sharing content in many different ways. Time spent looking for the link you saved weeks ago and want to share with a co-worker should be time spent doing more of what you love.
<br>
<br>
<b>SOLUTION</b>
<br>
Results from user research and competitive analysis showed trove could stand out as a service for both personal and business use, where users could store any type of content. Users wanted trove to be as easy as jotting a note down on pen and paper but also accessible across all of their devices, at any time. The result is trove’s straightforward, friendly interface where content takes priority.
<br>
<br>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<br>
Trove accomplishes its goal to give users and collaborators one space to quickly organize and find content on any device. Through research, design, and user testing, an interface was developed that is straightforward and welcoming. Research and user testing was a crucial part of creating trove. Users provided actionable feedback on button and menu placement that made the interface easier to use.
